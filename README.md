# Advent of Code 2024

Welcome to my solutions for the Advent of Code 2024! This repository contains my personal solutions to the coding challenges presented in the Advent of Code event for the year 2024.

## What is Advent of Code

[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) is an annual coding event that takes place in December. Every day from December 1st to December 25th, a new programming challenge is released. These challenges are a great way to improve your coding skills and have fun solving problems.

## Repository Structure

The repo is organized day-wise, with each day's solution contained in its own directory.

- `input.txt`: The input data for the day's challenge. **This is not a part of the repository as every user gets their own input**.
- `solution.py` (or other language files): The script containing my solution to the challenge.
- `README.md`: A brief explanation of the challenge.
